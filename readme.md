# Personal Project Tracker

This is a personal project tracker for myself. The projects listed here represent all the things I plan to build initially as I learn and grow in my development journey. Each project targets different aspects of software development, allowing me to explore front-end, back-end, full-stack, and even DevOps concepts.

## Features

- **Project List:** View a list of projects with their descriptions.
- **Progress Tracking:** Update the progress of each project (0-100%) and visually track it with a progress bar.
- **Save Progress:** All project progress is stored locally using `localStorage`, so your updates are saved even when you reload the page.
- **Interactive UI:** Responsive, black-and-white themed design that makes the tracker easy to use.

## Project Goals

Each project in this tracker represents a key area in software development, such as:
- Front-end development
- Back-end services
- Full-stack applications
- DevOps
- Cloud technologies
- Machine learning
- Internet of Things (IoT)

These projects serve as a way for me to practice and learn the necessary skills to build full-featured applications and systems.

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
